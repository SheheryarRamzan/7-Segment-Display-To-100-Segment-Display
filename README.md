# 7-Segment-Display-To-100-Segment-Display
Transforming a 7-segment display into a dynamic 100-segment display using Proteus simulation. Enhancing visual output for greater data representation and visualization in electronic circuits.

Description:

The 100-Segment Display Conversion Project aims to upgrade a traditional 7-segment display to a dynamic 100-segment display using Proteus simulation. The enhanced display offers superior data representation and visualization capabilities for electronic circuits.

Key Features:

Conversion of 7-segment to 100-segment display
Proteus simulation for accurate testing
Enhanced data visualization and representation
Open-source project for easy collaboration

Installation:

Clone the repository
Open the project in Proteus
Run the simulation to visualize the display conversion
